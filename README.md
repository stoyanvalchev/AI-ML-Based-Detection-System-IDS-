# AI/ML-Based Detection System (IDS)

This repository contains an AI/ML-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to detect network intrusions using machine learning algorithms. It uses preprocessed network traffic data, extracts relevant features, trains a classifier, and performs real-time or batch predictions.

## Features

- 📦 Preprocessing and feature extraction from raw network traffic.
- 🧠 Machine Learning model training and serialization.
- 🔍 Real-time packet sniffing and attack prediction.
- 📊 Utilizes CICIDS2017 dataset for training/testing.

## Repository Structure

- `extract_features.py` – Script for feature extraction from raw data  
- `train_model.py` – Trains ML model on network data  
- `sniff_predict.py` – Sniffs network packets and predicts intrusions  
- `model.pkl` – Pre-trained ML model  
- `scaler.pkl` – Scaler used to normalize input features  
- `top_features_portscan.csv` – Selected top features for detection  
- `Friday-WorkingHours...csv` – Sample dataset used for training/testing  
- `LICENSE` – Project license  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- scapy

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
